## Features

### Impact Analysis & Enhanced Lineage

Updated capabilities for tracking downstream impact to tables, ML models, and dashboards from any source table. The Impact Analysis view includes contact information for stakeholders, helping users identify whom to reach out when making schema changes, addressing quality issues, or planning other table modifications.

- This new view will speed up issue resolution and troubleshooting, helping to fix broken processes within the organization.
- Moreover, it helps to quickly analyze both the owner and domain of the impacted assets by any change or failure.

### New OpenMetadata SDK 2.0

Weâ€™re rolling a new SDK for both Java and Python, to make it easier to interact with different entities.

The main changes have been around the Java SDK, where we are adopting a Fluent API design to help you chain operations and streamline your work.

The existing Python SDK is still going to be internally used for the Ingestion Framework, but we recommend users to review the new SDK for their scripts and automation's.

### Drive Support

- Files Spreadsheet

### Enhanced SSO Setup & Configuration

â€‹**â€‹Independent SSO Configuration**: Customer admins can now configure Google and Azure SSO directly from the OpenMetadata UI, removing the dependency on DevOps teams for manual setup.

**SSO Mapping Updates**: Improved mapping flexibility to streamline SSO setup and customization.

ðŸ‘‰ Try it out here: [SSO Settings]('https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/settings/sso?provider=google')

### Data Contract UI Improvements

**Unified Contract Format**: Data contracts now follow a redesigned layout modeled after a legal contract style, making them more structured and easier to interpret.

**New Contract Components**: Three new sections have been added to support richer agreements:

- **Terms of Service (TOS)** â€“ Define usage guidelines, including AI agent data usage policies.
- **Security** â€“ Document security controls and compliance requirements.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** â€“ Specify service guarantees, which also integrate with **anomaly detection triggers** for proactive monitoring.

### Custom Metrics Measurement Units

**User-Defined Units**: Users can now create and assign **custom measurement units** for metrics, such as Pounds, dB, or any other unit relevant to their data.

### Connectors!

- TimescaleDB

## Breaking Changes

- Ingestion Framework: All workflows have integrated the `workflow.print_status()` inside the `workflow.execute()` call. This change was needed to better handle logger lifecycles. If youâ€™re using the Ingestion Framework directly to manage workflows via the usual process:

  ```
  workflow_config = yaml.safe_load(CONFIG)
  workflow = MetadataWorkflow.create(workflow_config)
  workflow.execute()
  workflow.raise_from_status()
  workflow.print_status()  # Not necessary anymore
  workflow.stop()
  ```

  You can now remove the `print_status()` call. Note that the only side effect would be temporarily getting duplicated summary logs.

- Changed field from **status** to **entityStatus** for **glossaryTerm** and **dataContract**, as we introduce it for different data assets.
  - For Data Contracts, the value also changed from **Active** to **Approved**.
