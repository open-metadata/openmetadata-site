## Features

### ðŸš€ OpenMetadata MCP Server â€” Generative-AI-Ready Metadata Providing Rich Data Context

OpenMetadata 1.8 debuts an enterprise-grade MCP server built natively on top of our unified knowledge graph. This new service exposes a single, high-performance API layer that lets any Large Language Modelâ€”or any downstream applicationâ€”pull rich, policy-aware context about your data in real time.

MCP Server:

â€¢ **One graph, One endpoint:** The MCP server surfaces every entity, relationship, data quality, lineage and governance youâ€™ve already enriched in OpenMetadata.
â€¢ **LLM-friendly responses:** JSON schemas are optimized for semantic search and RAG workflows, so your chatbots and copilots can ground answers in trustworthy, up-to-date metadata.
â€¢ **Enterprise-ready controls:** Provides real-time KPIs on asset distribution, metadata coverage (descriptions, ownership), tiering, and PII tagging to proactively improve data governance.
â€¢ **Zero-friction adoption:** It ships with OpenMetadataâ€”just enable the service, grab an API key, and start querying from Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT etc..

With MCP, every data consumerâ€”from analysts in a BI tool to autonomous agents writing SQLâ€”can instantly understand tables, lineage, quality, and ownership without leaving their workflow.

### SCIM Provisioning for Okta & Azure AD â€” Hands-free User & Group Management

Collate 1.8 extends our SSO portfolio with native SCIM 2.0 support, starting with Okta and Azure Active Directory. Enterprises can now manage the full user-lifecycle directly from their Identity Providerâ€”no more CSV uploads or manual role assignments

â€¢ **Automated onboarding & off-boarding:** The Tier Agent analyzes usage patterns and lineage to automatically identify the business-critical data assets within your organization.
â€¢ **Consistent governance:** The Documentation Agent automatically generates accurate descriptions of your data assets and powers a seamless Text2SQL chat experience.
â€¢ **Standards-based interoperability:** Built on the SCIM specification so future IdPs (JumpCloud, OneLogin, etc.) can be added with minimal effort.

Coupled with existing SAML/OIDC SSO, SCIM rounds out a turn-key identity stackâ€”letting security teams sleep easy while data users get frictionless access.
