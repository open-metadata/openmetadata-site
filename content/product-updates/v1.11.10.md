## Breaking Changes

### Ingestion Framework Upgrade Required

Schema changes introduced in earlier minor releases require the ingestion framework to be upgraded when moving to 1.11.10.

#### Changes Introduced

- **1.11.5:** Added `queryStatementSource` field to Postgres connection
- **1.11.5:** Added `queryParserConfig` field to Dashboard service
- **1.11.9:** Added `statusLookbackDays` field to Pipeline service

If the ingestion framework version is older and does not support these fields, you may encounter:
- ValidationError during pipeline deployment
- Airflow DAG build failures
- Configuration parsing errors

#### Required Action

When upgrading to 1.11.10, you must also upgrade your ingestion framework to 1.11.10. Running mismatched versions may result in schema validation failures and pipeline deployment issues.
